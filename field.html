        <p class="one">The Fields are still and quiet. The windmills blow in the gentle breeze and the workday is keeping all the village hands busy. A horse whinnies in the distance and dust billows off the plows and swirls in the air.</p>


        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        <a href="#" class="button d1a">A Farmer</a>

  <p class="d1a"> Your work is hard and your days are long. As you come to the end of a long row of cabbages, you straiten up your stiff back and wipe the sweat from your brow. It is a hot day, but your work is now finished. On the horizon you see the long shadows of the standing stones just past the edge of the fields. Behind you lies your home, and your belly rumbles at the thought of dinner.
  </p>

  <p class="d1b">For an instant, you feel like you remember something, what it was like to have a body, a form, but just as fast the feeling fades, and you feel empty once again. You never come out during the day, the sunlight strains your eyes and exhausts you, but today you feel different. The world has changed.</p>

 <a href="#" class="button d2c">Wander the Village</a><br /><a href="#" class="button d2d">Visit the stones</a></p>


  <p class="d2a">You take out your handkerchief and dab it under your wide hat, then turn towards your humble home. The door creaks when you enter and when you close it again the dust jumps off and settles in the air. The sunlight beams through the cracks in the wood making your home feel smaller. Your elderly mother rests in a chair by the window. She is sound asleep so she does not hear you enter, and you take a moment to remember what that aged face looked like when you were young. You hang up your hat and give her a small kiss on the top of her head. She does not stir but you feel she senses you in her own way. A small token she wears around her neck glistens in the sunlight, it reminds you of the mother you knew when you were small. You wish that she would remember you again one day. You decide to start dinner.
  </p>

  <p class="d2b">
    The standing stones have been there your whole life. When you were young, your mother always warned you to not go near them. But today something is different. Another shadow stands there in the middle. An old man looking at the stones. Your curiosity gets the better of you and you decide to walk over. 

As you get close you realize you don’t recognize him from your village. But there’s something about him that seems familiar anyway. He is standing in the middle of the stones, staring at them. When your foot enters the circle he turns.
“Ah it’s you,” he says in a familiar tone, though you still do not recognize him. His voice feels ancient and resonates deep in his chest. “Do you know what these stones are?” you look around at them, they seem bigger somehow, up close. “They are almost as old as I,” the man says. You begin to wonder just how old this man is, as it was said these stones are as old as the land itself. But you don't get time to ask before the old man begins to speak with his eyes closed:

 “Stone of spirits, 
Stone of calamities, 
Stone of life, 
Stone of humanity. 
A piece of power to 
complete each one, 
only then is this
story all done.”
