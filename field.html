        <p>The Fields are still and quiet. The windmills blow in the gentle breeze and the workday is keeping all the village hands busy. A horse whinnies in the distance and dust billows off the plows and swirls in the air.</p>

  <p class="aone"> Your work is hard and your days are long. As you come to the end of a long row of cabbages, you straiten up your stiff back and wipe the sweat from your brow. It is a hot day, but your work is now finished. On the horizon you see the long shadows of the standing stones just past the edge of the fields. Behind you lies your home, and your belly rumbles at the thought of dinner.

  <p class="atwo">You take out your handkerchief and dab it under your wide hat, then turn towards your humble home. The door creaks when you enter and when you close it again the dust jumps off and settles in the air. The sunlight beams through the cracks in the wood making your home feel smaller. Your elderly mother rests in a chair by the window. She is sound asleep so she does not hear you enter, and you take a moment to remember what that aged face looked like when you were young. You hang up your hat and give her a small kiss on the top of her head. She does not stir but you feel she senses you in her own way. A small token she wears around her neck glistens in the sunlight, it reminds you of the mother you knew when you were small. You wish that she would remember you again one day. You decide to start dinner.

  <p class="btwo"> You take out your handkerchief and dab it under your wide hat, then turn towards your humble home. The door creaks when you enter and when you close it again the dust jumps off and settles in the air. The sunlight beams through the cracks in the wood making your home feel smaller. Your elderly mother rests in a chair by the window. She turns a heavy head when she sees you. Her alert face makes you smile. You waste no time walking over to her and kissing the top of her head in greeting. You begin to move away when she touches your hand. You crouch down beside her. “Mama” she mumbles as she looks towards you. You chuckle, “yes you are my mama.” She seems less foggy today. She reaches up to her necklace and fumbles with the token before it detaches and she places it in your hand. It feels strange to the touch. You are gripped with a sense of power, but it is gentle.
