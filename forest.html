        <p class="one">The forest is deep and thick with many dangerous paths to wander. This is the kingdom of the trees where the laws of man feel far away. Even kings must tread carefully here.</p>


        <h1>Who are you?</h1>
        <a href="#" class="button f1a">A Human</a>

 <div class="f1a"> 
  <p> One of the greatest aspects of the human experience is a disappointment. You are a lizard. You can see colors and shapes behind the glass walls that surround you. A cranky young woman mumbles to herself while stirring a large cauldron. The witch is a terrible person. After all, it is because of her that you are trapped in this bottle. You stare at her through the glass, willing her with your mind to feel your angry glare, but she doesn't seem to notice.

  <a href="#" class="button f2a">Get her Attention</a>

<div class="f1b"> 
  <p>You are a sight to see. Taller than most horses, hairy, and teeth sharp as knives. Your hands are strong and have long sharp claws at the end of each finger. But as much as people shriek with fear when they see you, you don’t feel like the monster you seem to be. 

    You have a handful of red flowers in one hand, which you hold carefully so as to not crush them. Your friend asked you to bring them to her. You pick a few more before realizing the sun is high in the sky already. You look around you, getting your bearings to head back to your friend's home but you also notice how the flowers become more beautiful heading towards the main road.
    </p>

 <a href="#" class="button f2c">Head to your friend's house</a>
 <a href="#" class="button f2d">Wander Towards the Main Road</a>

</div>
<div class="f2d">
  <p>
    You wander towards the road with your flowers. To your excitement, they are more vibrant here and you continue to pick them while walking alongside the small dirt path. You hear a clatter to your right. You didn’t notice in all your flower picking a group of humans crowded beside an upturned cart. Their horses had seen you and gotten spooked, taking off down the road. You’d always liked horses. They’re so cute.
 
Two of the bigger humans raise their spears valiantly towards you, although they are still trembling next to each other in fear. They consider you for a moment and mutter between themselves in frantic voices. Finally one of them shouts nervously,<br><br> “ We are here in service of his majesty the king, searching the woods for his son Prince Florian,” his voice breaks a bit but he clears it and continues, “ State your-” he gulps “...business here”. You take a careful step forward, trying not to shake the trees too much. One of the men backs up over an upturned shield and makes a large clatter which spooks one of the men to turn and run into the woods. Two of the men still hold spears out towards you and four others are grabbing their weapons as well. You’ve never been good at speaking, you have a mouth of large teeth and vocal cords meant for terror. But as your good friend always says, there's no shame in trying something new. You open your mouth and let the airflow through it. You begin hollering through your open lips. You try to move your mouth around a bit as you do but in the place of words come guttural sounds that resonate through the leaves of trees causing the few birds that remain to fly away. 

Suddenly you feel a sharp pain in your throat, and then another, two spears stick out of your neck. You fall to your knees, suddenly afraid, you look up to the see the rest of the men charging towards you.

  <p class="death"> <i>
    You are too afraid to fight back. The men kill you with several spears and several swords. Your bones are kept as trophies.  </i>

    You hurry back to your friend’s cottage. She lives in a small clearing in the woods and the sunshine feels warm on your back as you step out from the shade of the treeline. You give the little door a knock and an even littler woman opens it. She welcomes you warmly and tells you to come inside. You have to get down real low to get through the doorway and you come to sit on the floor of her large circular house. Your friend takes the flowers and thanks you before turning them over and carefully removing the thorns, plucking off each one and plopping them into a large black cauldron. The mixture sizzles and you lean forward to sniff it.<br><br> “Smells good ey?” says the woman as she pours herself a cup of the liquid. “Bramblethorn tea is perfect for days like this.” She takes a much larger bowl out of her cupboard and pours another glass for you. You take a sip. The mixture burns your tongue and you jerk your arms in panic, accidentally bumping into a large cabinet. A few jars and vials come crashing to the ground, breaking on the stone floor. Some have powders or gemstones inside, while others have liquids. The young woman runs over to stabilize the rest of the jars and you catch out of the corner of your eye a small animal darting away. <br><br>“Aw rats.” she sighs looking at the mess, You scratch your head confused. It looked more like a lizard to you, but you shrug. <br><br>“It’s okay big guy, nothing a broom can’t fix. Just remember to blow on it next time.” She chuckles and sits down on the floor next to you.

        You may not have many friends, but it's nice to have just one best friend. You spend the rest of your days together growing old, and drinking tea, and picking flowers.</i>

<div class="f2a"> 
  <p> You bang your nose against the glass making as loud as a tap that you can muster, which is not actually that loud, but it seems to faintly get the attention of the witch, who tells you to shut it. You tap again anyway despite it making your head spin. She leans over your jail and sticks her tongue out at you.<br>
    <br> “Be grateful this tea doesn’t require lizard eyes or you’d be on the chopping block!” she picks up the bottle and shakes it. “Now stop that racket.” she sets you back down. You are too tired and dizzy to continue so you curl up at the bottom.

    You climb up the top and chew on the cork stopper, but it does very little as you have no teeth. You stretch out your tail and try to shatter the glass from the inside but you are too little to make it budge. You struggle and flop against the inside of the bottle until you are too tired to continue.
