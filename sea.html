        <p class="one">The ocean is calm and quiet. Gentle waves rock and thunder into each other, The only thing that reigns here is chaos, Great unknown creatures lie just beneath the surface of the water and the clouds move slowly above you.</p>

 <div class="s1a"> 
  <p> The ship rocks gently and the terrible might of the sun beams down from its place high in the sky. You breathe heavily and a bead of sweat makes it down your back. <br><br> 
	“HEAVE!”, you hear the boatswain call, The ropes are digging into your calloused hands and you and your fellow deckhands heave together, again and again. You hold your eyes shut, the pain in your muscles growing steadily.<br><br> “HOLD! And… that's it! You can let her down gently now!” We slowly walk the slack back into the ropes and all take a sigh of relief. On the other end of the ropes, the artifact is gently lowered onto the deck, little pockets of the coral still gushing out saltwater. Behind all the sea anemones and barnacles lay a solid wooden block with decaying metal all around the edges sealing whatever is inside deep under the surface. <br><br> You never would have guessed that there was anything inside of an object like this but you believed your captain, she had never led you astray before. The captain slaps the back of the boatswain so hard dust rises off his tunic and she lets out a bellowing laugh. You wipe the sweat from your brow and join your crew who were all gathering around it, trying to spot gold or silver somewhere behind the algae and clam-covered shell. Your captain motions to the boatswain and he quickly runs across deck and brings the captain a large ax. With one terrifying swing, the artifact is broken clean in half.<br><br> 

The crew gasped at what they saw inside, but you did not see it. You had noticed sudden darkness descend upon the deck and had looked up. The sun had disappeared and the clouds are circling above you, a storm brewing in a matter of seconds. You have never in all your years on the sea seen such a change and your stomach drops, you are all in grave danger. You clasp your hands together and drop to your knees in prayer, to the old gods perhaps, to the sea and sky so they might save you, to anything that could be listening. <br><br>

Your crew suddenly stopped chattering when a growl echoed below the surface of the water. They listened but they were too late to react. The tail of a great water serpent shoots up out of the water and comes down like a hammer against the top deck. Splinters get blown in every direction and the boatswain had not uttered a scream before he is thrown from the ship and into the water. All around you the crew is running, screaming, and jumping off the deck. You catch a glimpse of the captain in the madness who has her sword in hand, ready to defeat the beast single-handed on her sinking ship. The deck shakes again and amongst the chaos, the artifact is left exposed, the crew no longer paying its mind. You are taken aback as you see whats inside it for the first time. In its center is the most beautiful thing you've ever seen, a perfect glass orb which shines with light and swirls like fog. The longer you look, the longer you think you see a shape moving around deep inside, but you can’t make out what it is from this distance.

  <p> The crashing waves of the sea are far above you. You are looking for a place to call home for your people, but none so far have been the right place. You are a leader among Merpeople, having lived for countless decades under the sea and protected your people from many foes, But now you are in dire need of a new home, for the last one was raised to the ground in a calamity unknown to you. Now you must prove yourself once more, and find for your people a new home. Here on the bottom of the sea, the ocean is quiet and you can swim for miles at a time. Ducking in and out of coral reefs, you watch the sandworms pop in and out of their holes. Suddenly you come across a large shipwreck, old and overgrown with barnacles and muscles. Strange, you thought. With all that space you would think more fish would make their home here.

    You didn't notice the large sea serpent until it was too late. The great monster dived and gulped you down with very little effort, before settling back down on his shipwreck home.

  <p>You rush to your captain's side, grabbing a sword from the dead hands of a fellow sailor. 
    The captain screams like a banshee. You don’t have time to even think about how you'll help before she grabs you and throws you a rope. <br><br> “Quick! Tie this down!’ she screams and ducks as the giant tail of the beast narrowly avoids her head, taking the feather of her hat with it and dragging it down into the depths below. She ties down another line quickly and pulls a kaig of gunpowder into a bundle of fishing nets. She pulls the bundle into the air on one of the ropes suspending it from the mast.<br><br>  “When I give the order you cut this line!” she screams at you gesturing to the rope, and before you can question she grips her sword in her teeth and climbs up the mast. The other end of the deck is slipping slowly into the water and you hold the sword out clumsy in front of you, trying to feel ready for anything. Suddenly you feel water drops on the back of your head. You look up to see the full height of the serpent above you. You hold out your sword pathetically but then, another shape jumps down from the mast. Your captain! She lands on the creature's head sword flailing like a demigod descending from the heavens. She skewers it squarely in the neck wripping a hole from its ear down to its throat before getting stuck. The beast opens its mouth to let out a massive shriek, angrier than ever.<br><br>  ”Now!” Your captain screams. You turn and you slice clean through the ropes, the bundle of gunpowder and fishing line comes crashing directly into the beast's mouth, igniting on a sharp edge and blowing the head of the beast into little pieces. The blood and meat come raining down on the wreckage of the ship and finally the sea is quiet again.<br><br> 
    
    You grab hold of one of the lines as your feet are now deep in seawater. Where was your captain? You rush to the edge of the ship, which was now almost entirely gone, and spot her tangled in some of the masts looking a bit dazed. You jump into the water without thinking and untangle her from the wreckage. You pull yourselves onto a large chunk of the hull which seems sturdy enough and you both sit there quietly catching your breath. A few of the crew are still alive, although most are in bad shape. You are grateful to be alive. You work together securing pieces of wreckage together with lines and nets. Someone even managed to find some teeth of the great serpent floating around in the water. No one saw the orb sink quietly into the sea.    
  </p>
  <p class="death"><i>You are rescued by another vessel and return to land with your crew. You decide not to return to the sea, instead you decide to start a small business selling fishing tackle and wares. Sometimes your old captain comes in for some supplies. You live a long time but you never forget that day.</i></p>

<p>The crashing waves of the sea are far above you. You are looking for a place to call home for your people, but none so far have been the right place. You are a leader among merpeople, having lived for countless decades under the sea and protected your people from many foes, But now you are in dire need of a new home, for the last one was raised to the ground in a calamity unknown to you. Now you must prove yourself once more, and find for your people a new home. Here on the bottom of the sea, the ocean is quiet and you can swim for miles at a time. Ducking in and out of coral reefs, you watch the sandworms pop in and out of their holes. Suddenly you come across a large shipwreck, old and overgrown with barnacles and muscles. Strange, you thought. With all that space you would think more fish would make their home here. <br><br>

  You swim closer and see the holes alongside the hull where you assume a great ship battle had taken place skeletons litter the bottom of the wreck, humans who were trapped under the sinking wreckage. This could be the place, your new home. As you consider the space you spot something peculiar down inside the ship. In the center of the ruin, is something shiny, and out of place in the ghastly deteriorating ship. It is an Orb that glows with a faint light. You swim down to take a closer look at it and as you get closer you see it swirl around like clouds on the inside, and it bubbles gently. You pick it up in your scaly hands and look long and deep. You sense magic in your scales. Your kind has always found great resistance to the malevolent effects of magic, but this feels very powerful indeed. <br><br>
  Suddenly a face appears deep in the orb and it grows closer to the glass surface, gazing at you with eyes that look very old and tired.  You meet its gaze, and for a moment the two of you just look at each other, the beauty of this glowing object is not lost on you, and you carefully run a finger down the side of the glass surface, It watches your finger with intelligence but it looks sadly back at you. The face is human in shape, unlike your own with scales and gills. You know a few human languages but they are impossible to speak down here. Perhaps that is why this remaining silent, you think. You take the heavy orb in your arms and swim up towards the surface, while the face watches you curiously. 
  The sunlight at the surface makes you squint as your eyes adjust to the light and you slowly raise the orb out of the water revealing the face to the air above. <br><br>
  
    “I am the jin of calamities,” the face speaks. “I have watched empires rise and fall and have given the power of the sea to many humans before you. If you accept my gift, you shall also receive this power.” You are taken aback.<br><br>
  
  “Forever?” you ask.<br><br>
  
   “Either until you die, or the glass of the orb shatters, and our bond is broken.” The face responds. You look at the face deeply. The sky above you darkens and clouds you had not seen before begin to swirl above you. 
  </p>
  <a href="#" class="button s2d2">Accept</a>
  <a href="#" class="button s2c2">Refuse</a>
  </div>
  <div class="s2d2">
<p>
  The thought of how much this power could help your people worms its way into your brain, and you are unable to think of anything else. You nod your head and Jin looks at you quietly. “I accept,” you say firmly. The face nods inside the orb, for a moment you think you see its face fall back into the look of sadness you first found it in. The jins face disappears and you feel a surge of power into your scales and spine. Lighting fills your palms, your claws, and your long sharp teeth. In one singular moment of agony, you are filled with a power that is beautiful and terrifying. The face in the orb disappears again and leaves you to dive back down into the sea alone. With your newfound power, you find great ease in building your new kingdom. 
</p>
<p class="death">
<i>

Your people are happy for a time, but they notice you are not the same. Your lust for power leads you to act rashly and war descends on the bottom of the sea, for years, bloodshed becomes your legacy and your people abandon you. There is no one around to notice your unnaturally long life and you suffer ages alone in your shipwreck home, with only the orb to watch you silently before you, like all those who had come before, return to dust.

</p>
  </div>
  <div class="s2c2">
<p>
  You feel drawn towards this jin. Trapped in its orb of glass. The power of the sea and sky that is contained within is almost too much to say no to, after all, a power such as this could help your people greatly. You open your mouth to say no but choke on the words, every part of you is itching to accept this power, and your teeth begin to chatter involuntarily. You have had enough of this awful feeling. The Jin watches with surprise as you raise a large hand and sink a sharpened claw deep into the glass, shattering its perfect surface and sending cracks all throughout the orb. Then it shatters, crumbling to nothing more than dust in your hands, and you feel a great release as the power that gripped you falls away. <br><br>
 Then the face reappears in the air above you, with a body of a man below him. He hovers in the air above the water but then raises his arms to look at his hands. He turns back to you and raises his arms. The waters of the sea begin to rise and swirl in the air, blurring the boundary between sea and sky. you are raised up, droplets cast in every direction and your large tail struggles to keep you balanced as you hover. The human takes your hands in his. You look into his eyes as the two of you swirl in the pockets of water and air. <br><br>
	“You have freed me” his old face smiles. “I have been trapped for thousands of years, forced to give up my power to others. Thank you.” You look back at him and give a nervous smile back. “Take this as a gift,  It is a small token of my power.” he holds out a small stone to you the same size as a pearl. “use it to help your people, and ensure no calamities befall them again.”  You take the pearl and the Jin lets go, letting you and the waters sink back down where they belong before blinking away into the sky like a shooting star. 

</p>
<p class="death">
  <i>
    Your people named the small pearl, the heart of the sea. Its power protected the merpeople of the Orion Sea for many generations and your own children beg you to tell its story time and time again. You live a long and happy life and before you pass, your family and friends gather around you to say their goodbyes. As each one speaks you begin to look past them and see a familiar face in the crowd. <br><br> You get the feeling you will hold onto the pearl long after your death.

    You crawl across the deck as the chaos flows around you. The serpents fins peirce the hull like swords and tear the wooden boards appart. The ship you had known your whole life, the one which had always seen you home safe, was being shredded. You dodge wooden splinters and the frantic crewmebers and eventually reach the orb and gently pry it out of the artifact. The mast of the ship collapses and falls into the water and you notice the saltwater is already beginning to rise around you. <br><br>You look long and deep into the orb, knowing it might be the last thing you see in this world. The shadow reappears and it makes your head feel funny, the shapes mean nothing at first but then you sense, somehow, that it has a face. It hurts to look, but as you do you begin to understand a deep truth. Whatever being exists inside this orb: It is sad.  From across the deck, the captain is pulled into the water by a great mouth and the only thing that remains of her is the feather from her hat which blows in the wind off the deck and gently accross the water.

  </p>
  <p class="death"><i>The last thing you see is the shadow fade and the orb falls from your hands. The tail of the serpent slides across the deck and you are speared onto one of its many spines.
